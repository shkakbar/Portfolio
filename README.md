# Portfolio


Welcome to my data science repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks, and R markdown files (published at RPubs).

The R portfolio is located http://rpubs.com/sk_akbar and python portfolio is located https://github.com/shkakbar/Portfolio
