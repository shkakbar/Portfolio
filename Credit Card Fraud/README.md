# Credit Card Capstone project

## Project Overview

Banking industry works on credit and income from interest which can be in a form of mortgage, other types of loan or from Credit Card. As cost of having credit card reduced it got broadly accepted in society and many people started having credit card. As the credit card reached the masses, new ways of fraud also came to existence. Today, CC fraud is a very big problem for a banking industry and it is plaguing financial industries for years, some countries it is more less problem than others 

Solving this problem could bring about reduced volume of fraudulent transactions in financial industries hereby saving them a huge volume of money lost and this problem can be avoided by using predictive analytics where machine learning algorithms are used to detect fraud patterns and determine future probabilities and trends. 

The dataset to be used for this project was gotten from data.world

## Problem Statement / Metrics

Just by looking at the transaction, it is often difficult know which is fraudulent or genuine. We have a binary classification problem i.e. either a transaction is fraudulent or genuine. Objective is to create a model that accurately predicts whether a transaction is fraudulent or not. 

To solve this problem, first we will baseline the model and than run a predictive model on different machine learning algorithms on same dataset to see which will give the best performance which is better than the others, 

These algorithms include Naïve Bayes Classifier, SVC, GaussianNB, LogisticRegression, KNeighborsClassifier,  DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier, BaggingClassifier, ExtraTreesClassifier, XGBClassifier and AdaBoostClassifier. 

Dataset is normalized and all columns names changed before it is shared, it could also be a case where some of the features were reduced from original dataset, no other form of reduction would be made going forward. All features provided would be used in building the model. 

## Installation
In order to be able to execute your own python statements it should be noted that scripts are only tested on anaconda distribution 4.5.11 in combination with python 3.7 or above. The scripts don't require additional python libraries.
